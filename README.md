Idea is to create a pokedex that looks aesthetically pleasing and is functional on some level to help keep track of moving pokemon from game to game and bank to home.

This project has a mentor helping, as well as, learning along the way.

>Such as | Soul Silver > Ultra Sun > Pokemon Bank > Sword > Home

### **Start of Creating the Front End Design**
- Balsamiq

Using tools to create a mockup of the site.


- HTML

The design is to be a simple and functional pokedex that lets you select and view pokemon. A mockup will be made showing a tentative design for the webpage. So far this mockup has 4 parts to it: Search, Description, Sprite, Entries(List of Pokemon).

- CSS


Input will be pokemon name(with auto-complete) seach, or entry selection.


Output will have descriptions, and sprites. The basic mockup only took a few minutes to design. Based off many other pokedex creations.


I made a logo.

Start of HTML and CSS prototype. One of the steps required to create a component is to create the styling and divisions before putting it together in React.

First few steps are creating a few boxes and style them into a format of my choosing. The easiest way is using html to create the divs and then make a stylesheet. Adding this to the divs will have the desired design.
